## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Metadata

Two datasheets were shared with me on 11 March 2025, consisting of epiData (mixed with the ongoing workLab & workWGS information); I re-downloaded the data on 25 March 2025 and clarify the content on 26 March 2025 (denoted as \_ver3).

1.  **DATABASE PENELITIAN PNEUMOKOKUS (Manado, Lombok, Sorong, Sumbawa).xlsx**: An Excel file separated by sheets for every region (focused on Lombok and Sumbawa, but also including Manado and Papua). There are information about ongoing WGS preparation for problematic samples (the "need confirmation" sheets)
2.  **Data WGS_Lombok.xlsx**: An information storage for *in silico* WGS results for Lombok samples (Sumbawa is not available yet)

I found "frameshift mutation" in dataframe Lombok (possibly because WGS data are updated but previous WGS data were still denoted as "N/A"). And double ID for LBK_044; possibly caused by a live data updated by the lab team during laboratory analysis. I cleaned up the data directly from google sheet on 17 March 2025 and conducted data cleaning analyses locally.

```{R}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-17 12-41-09.png")
```

Value corrections (typographical errors) and other calculations during vaccination (HiB & PCV13)

```{R}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-24 10-35-33.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-24 10-37-38.png")
```

Missing value (NAs) imputation:

```{R}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-23 13-18-10.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-23 13-27-18.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-23 13-27-37.png")
```

For genomic data, I generate new ID called "dc_id" for fixing 49 ID names with naming inconsistencies.

### 1.2. Fasta data

324 files of WGS stored in \*.fasta format (including the metadata) were shared to me at 11 March 2025, consisting of 189 Lombok files and 135 Sumbawa files. Unfortunately, I have found 49 files with naming inconsistenciesâ€”these files are not match to their SPECIMEN ID in metadata.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-12 11-40-20.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/home/ron/pneumo_2025_lesserSundas/report/data_cleaning_pictures/Screenshot from 2025-03-12 11-24-47.png")
```

I copy these files in a separated folder, then perform a rename by adding underscore ("\_") between region code (LBK OR SWQ) and ID number.
